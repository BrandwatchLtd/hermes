# Contributing

To work on Hermes, you need Node.js installed (for npm). Clone the Hermes repo, and run

```bash
npm install
```

within the cloned directory.

Any added or changed functionality must be accompanied by tests in `test.js`. To run tests, open
`test.html` in your browser, or run `npm test`. The latter also lints code, and you should run this
before opening a pull request.
