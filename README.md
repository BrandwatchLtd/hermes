# Hermes

Hermes is a barebones notification system, designed to rely on css animations and transitions. You
supply css classes to it for animating/transitioning in new notifications and likewise for removing
notifications.

## Usage

```javascript
var notifier = hermes({
    maxNotifications: 5,                    // The maximum number of notifications you want to see.
                                            // If we go over, then the oldest notifications are
                                            // Animated out early (optional).

    container: notificationsContainer,      // A container to hook the notification list onto. This
                                            // may be a jQuery object.

    listClasses: 'notifications',           // CSS to apply to the list generated by hermes.

    styles: {                               // Define as many styles as you like!
        success: {
            shared: 'notification-success', // All states of the success notification have this CSS.
            in: 'notification-in',          // CSS to animate/transition in a new notification.
            paused: 'notification-paused',  // CSS to use when a notification is waiting (optional).
            out: 'notification-out',        // CSS to animate/transition a notification out.
            pauseTime: 3000                 // Waiting time between in and out states. Defaults to
                                            // 3000. In milliseconds.
        },
        error: {
            shared: 'notification-error',
            in: 'notification-in',
            paused: 'notification-paused',
            out: 'notification-out',
            pauseTime: 3000
        }
    }
});

// The notifier is an object with fields matching the styles in the config object fed to hermes.
notifier.success('Something went well.');
```

You can define as many styles as you like.

## Note

Hermes relies on animation/transition end events to know what state a notification should be in. If
the CSS provided for in or out styles lacks an animation or transition, Hermes will not work
properly.

## Contributing

To work on Hermes, you need Node.js installed (for npm). Clone the Hermes repo, and run

```bash
npm install
```

within the cloned directory.

Any added or changed functionality must be accompanied by tests in `test.js`. To run tests, open
`test.html` in your browser, or run `npm test`. The latter also lints code, and you should run this
before opening a pull request.
